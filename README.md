To-do-list-using-PHP
====================

To do list created with PHP.

This To do list includes css styling and can be downloaded as a ZIP with you only needing to enter your database details.

```
$db = new PDO('mysql:host=HOST NAME GOES HERE;dbname=DATABASE NAME GOES HERE', 'USERNAME GOES HERE', 'PASSWORD GOES HERE');
```

It can be intergrated within the OOP login and Register system as this project on its own just simulates a user being signed in through a session.
